# SpeedingUpR
A very simple guide to speeding up R on personal Windows devices. (coming soon) 

Revisions: 
* Revision 1: Rev1 will be uploaded soon, and will provide an easy way for Window's users to significantly speed up matrix operations on their personal device via the use of parallelization (using multiple threads) of their CPU. The guide will contain both background information, instructions, and timing results on my personal device, often achieving a speedup of two orders of magnitude. 
* Revision 2: Rev 2 will be future work with outsourcing the matrix operations to the GPU. For users with advanced graphics cards (an easy example is most people with a gaming laptop), this will provide an even faster speedup than the CPU strategy.
