# SpeedingUpR
(2022 most recent) A very simple guide to speeding up R on personal Windows devices. 

Revisions: 
* Revision 1: Rev1is now uploaded, and will provides an easy way for Window's users to significantly speed up matrix operations on their personal device via the use of parallelization (using multiple threads) of their CPU. The guide will contain both background information, instructions, and timing results on my personal device, often achieving a speedup of two orders of magnitude. 
* Revision 2: Rev 2 will be future work with outsourcing the matrix operations to the GPU. For users with advanced graphics cards (an easy example is most people with a gaming laptop), this will provide an even faster speedup than the CPU strategy. 

NOTE: Window's users who just want to speed up their R on their personal devices: skip straight to the "An Easy Speedup for Windows Users" section. The instructions there should be easy to follow, the background information will be helpful, and the timing results are just pleasing to look at!
